### Introduction
&ensp; Our team uncovered a not-so-perfect visualization of a news commentary that used a Nightingale rose diagram to make a presentation of the factors that business leaders value most about artificial intelligence (AI).
The link of the original visualization is:

### Other Work
&ensp; At the beginning of the work, we chose three visualizations that could be flawed. We replicated all two visualizations and made three improvements to the final selected diagram. We settled on a visualization that showed the 11 AI factors that business leaders value most.
&ensp; Those pre-work will be showen in catalogue **other_work**.  

### Catalogue Structure  
- Our reports are put in folder **report**.
- The code of replication and improvement lay in **project2.ipynb**, which is in folder **code**.
- The work we did in exploration is saved in folder **other_work**.
- All images needed are saved in folder **charts** of **report**.
